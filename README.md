# Coding Challenges

These are challenges that Iâ€™ve used or am using as exercises to learn a new programming language or technology.

Each challenge will have you writing a full application or tool. Most of which will be based on real world tools and utilities.

The challenges are picked to be small enough to completed in your spare time over a week or two and yet large enough to be complete working projects.
